# Tracker-Project
This is my Diploma final year project developed by me and my team.
Developed in Android studio for mobile application and one Arduino program.
We Designed and Developed a tracking device which fetch the location of device/laptop/vehicle even if it is not connected to internet and sends it to mobile application which shows location on google maps.
Below is Abtract of Project:
A Tracking Device is an electronic device installed in any vehicle or laptop or any device to enable the owner or a third party to track the vehicle's location. Offline location tracking is an emerging trend that locates users even if they are not connected to the internet.

The work focused on android based technology by modifying GPS for offline location tracking. This project proposed to design a tracking system that works using GPS and GSM technology, which would be the cheapest source of vehicle tracking and it would work as anti-theft system.

It is an embedded system which is used for tracking and positioning of any other device by using Global Positioning System (GPS) and Global system for mobile communication (GSM). This design will continuously monitor a moving Device or laptop or vehicle and report the status of the Device on demand. For doing so a microcontroller is interfaced serially to a GSM Modem and GPS Receiver.

A GSM modem is used to send the position (Latitude and Longitude) of the device from a remote place. The GPS modem will continuously give the data i.e. the latitude and longitude indicating the position of the device. The same data is sent to the mobile at the other end from where the position of the vehicle is demanded by using an android application. When the request by user is sent to the number at the GSM modem, the system automatically sends a return reply to that mobile indicating the position of the vehicle in terms of latitude and longitude in real time.
